    In aws_deveops this is our main file which is going to be run our application. so, we need to send these files in to a GitHub repository by using those commands.
             
             
            echo "# new" >> README.md ----- this is a README file 
            
            git init ------ intitialized empty git repository
            
            git add README.md ------ we are adding the READMe.md file
            
            git commit -m "first commit" ------ if its first project for that i want to share with github
                                                  but git was not understanding to our local machine exactly where to share the file
                                                  For that we need to change the mail id which is mention in github
                                                  For that purpose need to do use the config command 
                                                  i.e...
            metion in terminal git config email address
                               git config username
                               
                    We need to check the README.md file is created or not
                    
            git commit -m "first commit" ------- it create the mode of README.md file
            
            git branch -M main -----means creates in main branch 
            
            git remote add origin (link) which is connected to github
            
            git push -u origin main------ create in github 

            whether it create in github or not how to check in terminal
              
              git status ---> shows in red color those files are not commit in github 
              
              again same process will start in terminal for each n every folder we need to check the status
              
              
             STEPS:
              
                    git status (presented in red color which means those files are not commit to github)
                    
                    git add (particular floder name)
                    
                    git status (check the status) (which is presented to green color)
                    
                    git commit ("Any msg") 
                    
                    git status       
                    
                    git push origin main (enter username, password:which means token id)
                    
                    and go to the github repository and do refresh the file is added to the github.
